## 3. Core Process

**Administrator Flow:**
Administrators access the dashboard to view real-time remote connections, configure security settings, and manage blocking rules. They can drill down into connection details for threat analysis, execute immediate connection termination, and review historical data for security auditing.

**Standard User Flow:**
Standard users can view the dashboard for awareness of current remote connections, browse connection history for their sessions, and receive security alerts about their system's remote access activity.

**System Monitoring Flow:**
The system continuously monitors network connections, Windows services, and third-party remote access tools. When suspicious activity is detected, alerts are generated and appropriate automated responses are triggered based on configured rules.
